I am a Master's student in Materials Science and Engineering in the Department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My advisor is Yuecheng Peter Zhou.

My research centers on the reflectivity simulation of multi-layered polymer device. I use the mathematic tool such as optical TMM(Transfer Matrix Method) to simulate reflectivity and reflectivity over delta reflectivity. I utilize s-/p- polarized lights to model reflection in the devices to predict responses to neural signals.

I received my bachelor's degree in Materials Science and Engineering from Yonsei University in 2019, and I pursued the second bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering but I didn't complete it. I took one year of coursework in mechanical engineering and enough course to declare enough to minor in physics. 

Simulation

## Simulation Skills: TMM & Optical Physics
I am currently working on verifying transfer matrix algorithms for solar cell optimization.

Getting started
======


Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
