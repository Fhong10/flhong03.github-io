## Process of Fabrication
I underwent progresses such as exfoliation of 2D materials, transfer stage, photolithography, gold evaporator, and optical measurement.

1. I exfoliated Graphene, 𝑆𝑛𝑆𝑒2, W𝑆𝑒2, WS2, MoSe2, hBN.
2. Then I used transfer stage to stack layer by layer device.
3. I used photolithograph to build pathway for gold circuit.
4. Using gole evaporator I laid gold circuit.

### Result
## MoSe2/WS2 Heterostructure Device
I made a van der Waals heterostructure with monolayer of MoSe2 and WS2 protected by Boron Nitride(hBN).

We shone a laser on the device to excite electrons, creating excitons. By measuring reflectivity, they observed specific peaks that reveal the material's optical behavior.

Moreover, by chaning the voltages at the top and bottom gates, we controlled the density of electrons and holes and shifted material's energy levels. Through this voltage manipulation and by observing changes in the laser spectrum, we were able to tune the band alignment(transitioning between Type I or Type II alignment) 

## WSe2/WS2 Heterostructure Device

I built the similar stack using WS2 and WSe2 to study Terahertz Phonons(ultra-high frequency sound waves)

By applying the acoustic waves, we analyzed the behavior of inciden, reflected and trasmitted phonon pulses within the van der Waals heterostructure. This analysis helps in understanding how the materials in the heterostructure influence the propagation and behavior of terahertz phonons.
