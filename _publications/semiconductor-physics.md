## Process of Fabrication
I underwent progresses such as exfoliation of 2D materials, transfer stage, photolithography, gold evaporator, and optical measurement.

1. I exfoliated Graphene, 𝑆𝑛𝑆𝑒2, W𝑆𝑒2, WS2, MoSe2, hBN.
2. Then I used transfer stage to stack layer by layer device.
3. I used photolithograph to build pathway for gold circuit.
4. Using gole evaporator I laid gold circuit.


## MoSe2/WS2 Heterostructure Device
I made a van der Waals heterostructure with monolayer of MoSe2 and WS2 protected by Boron Nitride(hBN).

We illuminated the device with a laser and performed reflectance spectroscopy to track excitonic resonances The resulting reflectivity spectrum shows distinct peaks that reflect the material’s optical response.

By varying the top and bottom gate voltages, we tuned the electron and hole densities and shifted the relative band energies. This electrostatic control allowed us to tune the effective band gap in this type-II heterostructure.

## WSe2/WS2 Heterostructure Device

I built the similar stack using WS2 and WSe2 to study Terahertz Phonons(Ultra-high frequency sound waves)

Using ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy, coherent acoustic-phonon pulses propagate through the van der Waals heterostructure. By time-resolving the response, we can isolate the incident, reflected, and transmitted phonon arrivals. This provides a direct way to see how specific layers and interfaces in the heterostructure shape terahertz phonon propagation.
