## Process of Fabrication
I underwent progresses such as exfoliation of 2D materials, transfer stage, photolithography, gold evaporator, and optical measurement.

I exfoliated Graphene, 𝑆𝑛𝑆𝑒2, W𝑆𝑒2, WS2, MoSe2, hBN.
Then I used transfer stage to stack layer by layer device.
I used photolithograph to build pathway for gold circuit.
Using gole evaporator I laid gold circuit.
