## Process of Fabrication
I underwent progresses such as exfoliation of 2D materials, transfer stage, photolithography, gold evaporator, and optical measurement.

1. I exfoliated Graphene, 𝑆𝑛𝑆𝑒2, W𝑆𝑒2, WS2, MoSe2, hBN.
2. Then I used transfer stage to stack layer by layer device.
3. I used photolithograph to build pathway for gold circuit.
4. Using gole evaporator I laid gold circuit.

### Result

I made a van der Waals heterostructure with monolayer of MoSe2 and WS2 protected by Boron Nitride(hBN).

We shined the laser on the device to excite electrons, creating excitons. By measuring reflectivity, they could see specific peaks, telling how the material behaves optically.
Moreover, by chaning the voltages at top and bottom gate, we controlled density of electrons and holes and shift energy levels of materials. Through manipulation of voltage and observation of changes in laser spectrum, we can tune band alignment(shifting from Type 1 or Type 2 alignment)
