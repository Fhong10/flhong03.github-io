## Objective
This project analyzes the absorption coefficient ($\alpha$) of thin-film materials used in solar cell applications.

### Data Analysis
Using experimental data, I plotted the absorbance spectrum to identify bandgap edges.

## Conclusion
The material shows strong absorption in the UV-Blue region, tapering off towards the Red/IR, which is consistent with the bandgap energy of...
