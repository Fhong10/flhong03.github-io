## Motivation
To model reflectivity in multilayer device, refractive index is the important parameter. Especially, refractive index comprises of real part and imaginary part (n+ik). I calculated imaginary part which is extinction coefficient.

### Calcalation
I used UV-Vis spectroscopy to measure absorbance of PEDOT:PSS. Then I used the equations to solve extinction coefficients.



## Conclusion
The material shows strong absorption in the UV-Blue region, tapering off towards the Red/IR, which is consistent with the bandgap energy of...
