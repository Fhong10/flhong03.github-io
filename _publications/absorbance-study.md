## Motivation
To model reflectivity in multilayer device, refractive index is the important parameter. Especially, refractive index comprises of real part and imaginary part (n+ik). I calculated imaginary part which is extinction coefficient.

### Data Analysis
Using experimental data, I plotted the absorbance spectrum to identify bandgap edges.

## Conclusion
The material shows strong absorption in the UV-Blue region, tapering off towards the Red/IR, which is consistent with the bandgap energy of...
